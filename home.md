Hello There ! Thank-you for looking me up. 

A litle about me : I am a technology enthusiast currently pursuing my graduate studies, Masters in Computer Science and Engineering, from the University of California at San Deigo (UCSD). I enjoy programming, coding and learning new Software.


Previously, I worked as a Project Staff at the Super Computing Centre</a>, at the <a href = "http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a>, Bangalore. My work here was directed towards Automatic Task Partitioning of OpenCL kernels in Heterogeneous Systems using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques. 


I graduated from <a href = "http://manipal.edu/mu.html"> Manipal Institute of Technology </a> with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a CGPA of 9.41/10 in July 2015. Previously, I have worked with Professor <a href ="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0lMANmwAAAAJ&hl=en"> Rita Singh </a> and Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IWcGY98AAAAJ"> Bhiksha Raj </a> of the Language Technologies Insititute of Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the CMU Internship Program in Technology-Supported Education (IPTSE) program, and have also interned as a Summer Intern at Microsoft Bangalore.
