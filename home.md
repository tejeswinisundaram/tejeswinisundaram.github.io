<span style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently a project assistant in the <a href= "http://hpc.serc.iisc.ernet.in/"> High Performance Computing laboratory </a> of the <a href = "http://www.serc.iisc.in/"> Super Computing Education and Research Centre</a>, at the <a href = "http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a>. The main focus of the lab is on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing. My general interests are in the following topics:


  * Heterogeneous Accelerator-based Architectures
  * Parallel Computing
  * Machine Learning
  * Computer Architecture
  
My current research work at the laboratory focuses on Automatic Task Partitioning of OpenCL kernels in heterogeneous systems by using Supervised Machine Learning techniques. We achieve the task partitioning by using machine learning models to associate the static OpenCL code features to different partitioning schemes of the kernels. My Bachelor thesis project titled “Accelerated Computer Vision using Heterogeneous Coprocessors ” was also formulated at Indian Institute of Science, under the guidance of Professor Prema K.V (internal guide) and Professor R. Govindarajan (external guide) from January to June 2015. The Thesis was focussed on the optimized utilization of the many cores of Xeon Phi (MIC) for vision algorithms and applications. We analyzed the bottlenecks in performance of selected parallel vision algorithms on MIC, GPGPU and the Host CPU. A comparative study of the application performance, execution time, core utilization, and overheads in the OpenCL accelerated parallel vision algorithms of the OpenCV library was performed.

I graduated from <a href = "http://manipal.edu/mu.html"> Manipal Institute of Technology </a> with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a CGPA of 9.41/10 in July 2015. Previously, I have worked with Prof. Rita Singh and Prof. Bhiksha Raj of the Language Technologies Insititute of Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the CMU Internship Program in Technology-Supported Education (IPTSE) program, and have also interned as a summer intern at Microsoft Bangalore.
