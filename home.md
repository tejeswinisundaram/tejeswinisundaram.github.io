Hello. Greetings. 

<br/>

I am a technology enthusiast currently pursuing my graduate studies, a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering, from the University of California at San Deigo (UCSD). I am primarily interested in scalability, security and performance of large scale distributed systems.

<br/>

Prior to joining my Masters programme, I worked as a Research Assistant at the High Performance Computing (HPC) Laboratory at the Super Computing Research Facility <a href = "http://www.iisc.ernet.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a>, Bangalore under the guidance of Professor Govindarajan. My work here was directed towards parallelism, performance and scalability of systems. During my time here I have gained expertise in parallel systems and softwares and have worked with high compute environments. 

<br/>

I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from  <a href = "http://manipal.edu/mu.html"> Manipal Institute of Technology </a> in July 2015. As a part of my undegraduate research  I have worked with Professor <a href ="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0lMANmwAAAAJ&hl=en"> Rita Singh </a> and Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IWcGY98AAAAJ"> Bhiksha Raj </a> of the Language Technologies Insititute of Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the CMU Internship Program in Technology-Supported Education (IPTSE) program.

My internship experiences include a summer at Microsoft and Visa. During my time at Microsoft I worked on the data visualization framework on the cloud platform, and at Visa I worked with the Visa Data Secuirty team.
