<p> This page is dedicated to my non-academic and extra curricular activities.</p>

<span style="text-align: justify;">
Since my primary school, I have been actively involved in athletics, thanks to my coach in school - Miss Anna Jacob and the constant support from my father- who attended every sports day in school for 10 years, in a time when other parents were pushing kids towards academics. I have obtained formal training in field hockey, basketball and athletics in my school days and have competed in zonal and state-level competitions in the same. My Hockey Coach Mr. Leo Francis, was an amazing coach, and led our team in various competitions such as Tanvi Rao girls hockey tournament, and Girls Hockey Tournament at the KSHA Hockey Stadium. I played the position of Left Extreme and held the position of Captain in 2009. I cherish the days my basketball team participated in the Beagles Basketball tournaments in Bangalore. I have also been a regular participant of the KPMG Sports Meet held at Kanteerva Stadium in Bangalore. My favourite part of it being the 4X100 metres relay competitions and 100 metres race. My school's athletics team has won many laurels here. I was elected the Games Captain of St Francis Xavier Girls High School, Bangalore for the year 2008-09. In college, I continued playing basketball and was part of the team in my junior years.
