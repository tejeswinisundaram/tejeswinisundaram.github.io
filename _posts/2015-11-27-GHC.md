#####GHCI is around the corner and I am excited about it! 

Also, I have been awarded the Student Scholarship to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration. Yay !!


The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (India) is India's largest gathering of women technologists. 
It is produced by the Anita Borg Institute and presented in partnership with ACM India. The theme for this years conference is #OurTimeToLead. Check out the awesome poster designed by Croatian artist Bruno Budrovic for the purpose.
