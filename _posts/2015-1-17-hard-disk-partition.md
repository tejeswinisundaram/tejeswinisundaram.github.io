<li>On the left side of the window you will find Storage. Click on Disk Management under Storage. A new window will open up.</li>
<li>Right click on a free unallocated-drive on your hard-disk and click new simple volume.</li>
<li>Click Next.</li>
<li>You can either select the default size or type the size of he volume you wish to create. It is in megabytes (MB) and not gigabytes(GB).&nbsp;</li>
